        This is a staple horseradish cream, that my mom makes every Easter.
        Since I moved out this is the one Easter dish I always make sure to make
        too. You can make it however spicy you wish, by simply mixing in spicy
        or mild horseradish, or combining the two. As a kid I loved the mild
        version, but nowadays I do enjoy some spice in it!

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>140 g of 18% sour cream</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 small jars of horseradish (1 jar is usually ~200 g)</li>

          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Combine sour cream, raw eggs and sugar in a saucepan without heat.
            </li>
            <li>
              After mixing them thoroughly put it on heat and bring it to boil
              while constantly stirring. Let it cool off.
            </li>
            <li>
              While waiting for the mixture to cool, drain the horseradish on a
              sieve. You can press on the horseradish to make the fluids drain
              faster.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix everything together and put the cream to the fridge for a full
              day, so the flavours can fully combine.
            </li>
