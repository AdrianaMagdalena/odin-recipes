      This is a staple horseradish cream, that my mom makes every Easter. Since
      I moved out this is the one Easter dish I always make sure to make too.
      You can make it however spicy you wish, by simply mixing in spicy or mild
      horseradish, or combining the two. As a kid I loved the mild version, but
      nowadays I do enjoy some spice in it!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>140 g of 18% sour cream</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>2 small jars of horseradish (1 jar is usually ~200 g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine sour cream, raw eggs and sugar in a saucepan without heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        After mixing them thoroughly put it on heat and bring it to boil while
        constantly stirring. Let it cool off.
      </li>
      <li>
        While waiting for the mixture to cool, drain the horseradish on a sieve.
        You can press on the horseradish to make the fluids drain faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix everything together and put the cream to the fridge for a full day,
        so the flavours can fully combine.
      </li>
    </ol>
