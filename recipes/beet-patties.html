    <h2>
      Crunchy on the outside, soft in the inside - these beef patties are a
      perfect side to any dish. They're gluten-free and full of protein. They go
      exceptionally well with a warm

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>270 g beets</li>
      <li>100 g canned lentils or cooked lentils</li>
      <li>60 g red onion</li>
      <li>1 cm fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>pepper</li>
      <li>15 g tomato concentrate</li>
      <li>
        140 g gluten-free oat flour (all purpose flour can be used for non
        gluten-free version)
      </li>
      <li>coconut oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the peeled beetroot into smaller cubes and throw it in a blender,
        where it is thoroughly pureed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked lentils, chopped red onion, ginger, garlic, curry powder,
        salt, pepper and tomato paste and blend all together until relatively
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, mix the beetroot paste base with the oatmeal and form into 50
        g balls. Place them on a baking tray lined with baking paper, press them
        down to make flatter patties, and then, using a silicone brush, brush
        each side with a little melted coconut oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 180Â°C and bake the meatballs for 40 minutes. Wait
        5-6 minutes after they come out of the oven, so they peel off the baking
        paper more easily.
      </li>
    </ol>
